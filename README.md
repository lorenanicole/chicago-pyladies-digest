# chicago-pyladies-digest

Currently includes a Python script for pulling the latest Python tech events in Chicago and saving to a CSV.

Can define an optional MEETUP_KEY in a `config.yml` file else can pass one in:

```
python get_meetup_events.py --location Chicago --text python --category 34
```
